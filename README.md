# PhishingProject

The "Phishing Testing Platform" project is our guide, offering a hands-on adventure to
understand and combat the notorious phishing attacks. In this exploration, we build our own
phishing testing playground, equipped with tools to recognize, deflect, and learn from these
online scams. Our mission involves creating fake emails, selecting targets (all simulated, of
course!), and analyzing how people interact with our faux communications.

In this project which has been utilizing ASP.NET framework along with MVC library, we
have designed multiple component and pages to achieve our goal.
